## Background
• Atliq Grands noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months. To understand the cause of 
this loss, they needed a way to analyze this. I created a dashboard in Power BI using three months of data.

trend. This could help in regaining their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.
